        Hi, this is an example page. It's written in Jinja2 instead of Markdown
        and won't appear in the index or the archive sections of your blog.
        You can have as many pages as you wish, add metadata to them,
        build a sitemap, etc...
    </p>

        Let me guess... are you a programmer? This is the place to show off
        your projects. Or a contact page. Or you can be lazy, and just add
        a link to your own <a href="https://github.com">Github</a> profile...
    </p>
